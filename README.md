# ReverseEngine
ReverseEngine will first load an “APK” file, and then try to do reverse engineering on the application. In the progress of extracting its source code, some functions will be called to distinguish whether the source code has  been protected by Code Protection. There are also many modules in each step, every module contains different functions. More powerful modules will be added in the future.
